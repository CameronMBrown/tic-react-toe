# Tic React Toe

https://tic-react-toe.com/

thanks for checking out my project!
For a while I have been thinking about how this spin on the classic tic-tac-toe game would make for a perfect react project, so I made it!
The game is defined by its nested smaller tic-tac-toe games and the more interesting move pattern that allows for deeper strategies and more replayability.

### Features

##### Save Game

Each turn saves the gamestate to your browsers local storage. Refresh the page, close your browser, come back days later and your game will still be there.

##### Move Timer

Think quick! You only have a limited time to make your move, otherwise a random cell will be chosen for you. The move timer can be adjusted in the settings.
The timer is smart, if the game is not within the browsers' viewport, the game will pause itself behind the scenes.

##### Vs. Computer

No one to play with? No problem, just open the settings modal and enable the "Play against computer" toggle. The computer will choose a random available valid move on its turn. The computer is still improving, and higher computer difficulties are on the roadmap.

##### Responsive Design

This app should run great on your mobile device, tablet or ultrawide monitor.
I did my best to design the game in a visually interesting way, with animations that respond to you and visual feedback on how the game is going.

### Design

This app's state management is done with a reducer function that dispatches actions to a game context provider.
You can find this in src/store/GameStateContext.jsx

### Future Roadmap

- dark mode ðŸŒ‘
- disable move timer
- optimize mobile and touch events
- customize token colour
- customize token shape
- vs. computer difficulty settings
- accidental move protection
- restore default settings
